## Features

- Powered by Eleventy 3 with Markdown-it, footnotes, auto-generated heading anchors, and computed content metadata
- Tachyons-based, theme-aware typography and color palettes with runtime switching for site chrome, code blocks, and GitHub embeds
- Responsive navigation with a mobile hamburger menu, dark-theme-safe icon styling, and paginated home-page browsing
- Dedicated content surfaces for posts, drafts, notes, tags, projects, and curated series pages with cross-content series backlinks
- Reusable post list rendering with excerpt trimming, readable dates, and build-time pagination support
- Responsive image pipeline powered by `@11ty/eleventy-img` (see [Responsive Images with Eleventy Img](posts/subspace/responsive-images-eleventy-img.md))
- YAML-driven site metadata, series definitions, notes config, theme presets, animation timing controls, and optional Umami analytics
- Build-time Open Graph image generation for posts and notes, with cached regeneration to keep rebuilds cheap
- GitHub snippet and embed support via a `{% github %}` shortcode with remote fetch, syntax highlighting, collapsible embeds, copy support, and cache-aware refresh logic
- Docker and Compose support for local dev, local production preview, and shared-edge deployments

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or newer

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This sets `ELEVENTY_ENV=development` and starts Eleventy in watch/serve mode. Visit `http://localhost:8080` (default) to browse the site. Theme selections persist in `localStorage` so you can preview skins as you work.

### Local production preview

```bash
npm run prod
```

Runs the site with `ELEVENTY_ENV=production` while keeping Eleventy’s dev server running so you can QA the published experience without deploying.

### Production build

```bash
npm run build
```

This sets `ELEVENTY_ENV=production` and writes the static output to the `_site/` directory. Deploy those files to any static host or CDN.

### Starter reset wizard

```bash
npm run starter:reset
```

This interactive reset wizard helps downstream users clear sample posts, notes,
timeline entries, projects, images, and personal site metadata while optionally
adding starter placeholders back in. Each menu accepts `all`, `skip`, or mixed
numeric selections like `1 3 5`.

If you want to keep the current author/profile/projects layer and related
images, run:

```bash
npm run starter:reset -- --keep-personal-branding
```

For Nicholas's local workflow, there is also a shortcut:

```bash
npm run starter:nicholas
```

## Docker

- `compose.yml` uses the stock `node:25-bookworm-slim` image and installs dependencies at container start.
- Default mode (public ports): `docker compose up -d`
- Dev: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Prod: `http://127.0.0.1:8090`
- Shared-edge mode (no host ports; for reverse proxy via Caddy on the `edge` network): `docker network create edge 2>/dev/null || true`
- Run: `docker compose -f compose.yml -f compose.edge.yml up -d`
- Caddy (in the ingress stack) should `reverse_proxy` to the `dev` or `prod` container names on the `edge` network.

## Social Preview Images

- `scripts/generate-og-images.js` runs before each Eleventy build to produce 1200×630 Open Graph cards using Satori (HTML template) and Resvg. We stick with Satori’s HTML helper instead of JSX so the pipeline stays zero-transpile and works out-of-the-box in Node.
- Templates blend Lexend (heading) + Inter (body) with Noto Sans SC/TC fallback for Chinese text, all from `@fontsource/*`, and use the Sun theme palette (soft yellow gradient, amber accents, black typography); tweak `buildTemplate` to adjust the look.
- Headlines/excerpts auto-resize and truncate when needed so long titles (e.g. “The Joy (and Frustrations) of Building Small Sites with GPT-5 Codex”) stay legible without breaking the layout.
- Content hashing keeps regeneration cheap—changes to a post’s title, excerpt, or the template version trigger a refresh, otherwise cached PNGs in `.cache/og/` are reused.
- Use `npm run og` to generate cards manually, `npm run og -- --force` (or `OG_FORCE=true npx @11ty/eleventy`) to rebuild everything, and check the emitted file map in `_data/ogImages.json`.
- Posts, notes, and timeline entries automatically receive an `ogImage` field via computed data, so layouts and feeds can reference `{{ ogImage }}` without manual front matter tweaks. Static cards such as the timeline root page are configured in `_data/site.yaml` under `ogImage.staticEntries`.

## Project Structure

- `_data/` - Global data files (`site.yml` and `themes.yaml`) that drive metadata, theme options, and animation settings.
- `_includes/layouts/` - Base and page layouts, including the responsive navigation + theme selector UI in `home.njk`.
- `_includes/components/` - Shareable Nunjucks macros like `post-list.njk` for rendering excerpts.
- `posts/` - Blog posts and collection defaults (`posts.json` assigns the home layout to the collection).
- `eleventy.config.js` - Eleventy configuration, Markdown-it setup, the Eleventy Img transform, and custom filters (`readableDate`, `machineDate`, `excerpt`).
- `index.md` - Home page content that also uses the `home` layout.

## Configuration

### Site settings (`_data/site.yml`)

- `title`, `url`, and author contact details.
- `theme` block toggles the selector (`showSelectors`), controls animation timings, and sets the default theme (`defaultId`).
- `umami` block (optional) controls the analytics script URL (`source`) and tracking `id`; remove or comment it out to disable tracking.

### Comments (`giscus`)

- Giscus is optional and configured via the `giscus` block in `_data/site.yml`.
- Visit [giscus.app](https://giscus.app/) with your GitHub repository selected to generate the `repo`, `repoId`, `category`, and `categoryId` values—replace the defaults before enabling comments on your site.
- If you do not plan to use Giscus, delete or comment out the `giscus` block so any clones of this starter do not point comment traffic at someone else’s repository.
- The remaining attributes (`mapping`, `lang`, etc.) can stay at their defaults unless you want to tweak how threads are created or which language the widget uses.

### Theme presets (`_data/themes.yaml`)

Add, remove, or tweak Tachyons class pairs here. Each theme entry accepts:

- `id` - Unique identifier used for persistence and data attributes.
- `classes` - Tachyons classes applied to `html` when the theme is active.
- `midtoneClass` - Optional class used to recolor elements tagged with `.theme-midtone`.

## Writing Content

Create a new Markdown file in `posts/` with front matter similar to:

```markdown
---
title: My Next Adventure
date: 2025-02-01
time: '09:30'
eleventyNavigation:
  key: my-next-adventure
  parent: posts
excerpt: |
  A quick teaser paragraph that appears in post lists.
---

Your post content starts here. Eleventy handles Markdown -> HTML conversion.
```

Posts automatically pick up the layout defined in `posts/posts.json`. The optional `time` field lets you order posts or notes published on the same date. The `excerpt` field is optional; without it, the `excerpt` filter trims the rendered HTML.
Markdown footnotes now work too, using standard `[^1]` references plus `[^1]: note text` definitions, or inline `^[note text]` syntax.

## Components & Enhancements

- Use `{% from "components/post-list.njk" import renderPostList with context %}` inside a template to render a list of collection items with consistent styling.
- The `home.njk` layout wraps page content in a `<heading-anchors>` element to enable anchored headings and theme-aware typography.

## Deployment Tips

- Set `ELEVENTY_ENV=production` when building for production to leverage Eleventy’s environment-based defaults.
- Because Tachyons is loaded from a CDN, ensure outbound requests are allowed by your host or replace the `<link>` in `base.njk` with a bundled stylesheet.

## Releases

- Releases are managed by `release-please` via `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`.
- Push Conventional Commits to `main`; `feat:` triggers a minor release, `fix:` triggers a patch release, and `feat!:` or a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer triggers a major release.
- When release-worthy commits land, `release-please` opens or updates a release PR that bumps `package.json`, updates `package-lock.json`, and maintains `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Merging that release PR creates the Git tag and GitHub release automatically.
- `docs:` and `chore:` commits can still appear in the generated changelog, but they do not bump the version on their own.

## FAQ

### Why does the homepage say "No posts published yet" even though posts exist?

The home page runs `renderPostList(collections.posts, ...)` and Eleventy only adds templates to `collections.posts` when they are tagged `posts`. Make sure your post defaults include `"tags": ["posts"]`—for example, set it once in `posts/posts.json` so every Markdown file under `posts/` inherits the tag.

### Why are posts ordered oldest-first?

`collections.posts`, `collections.notes`, and `collections.hiddenNotes` are kept in ascending chronological order so the existing templates and pagination can reverse them for newest-first views. When you add `time: "HH:MM"` to post or note front matter, same-day items are sorted by time before those UI-level reversals run.
